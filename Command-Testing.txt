Checking out branches.


Results:
1> While merging u must have both the branch heads commited,
then u appeal for the merge and resolve if there are any conflicts there.

Now u can just commit in the master branch for the merge will take place.

2> If you dont have any commits in master after branching then if u merge into master
still you will not see any coloured arrows in the network tab, instead both the branches
will be kept in the same branch i.e. master.


Learning how to revert if its already pushed.
